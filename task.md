Your task is to write tests covering B+Tree functionality. Full test plan is in test_plan.md. For each plan point  
(like 1.1, 1.2 etc) create a separate test class. You can put them in a separate folder inside 
/Users/leonidchashnikov/Projects/cmu_bustub/test/storage. Other tests in project use gtest - use that as well, 
 don't add any new dependencies.
Don't write comments. Give tests descriptive names, clearly stating what function and in what scenario you're testing.
Don't write all tests at once. Create 1 test file, make sure it works and passes. Only after that you can go to next test file.
Do not change code functionality, just iterate on your tests.
